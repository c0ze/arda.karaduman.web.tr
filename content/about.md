## My Story

I was introduced to computers at a very early age in my life. My first computer
was a [msx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) clone which I got when I was 5 years old. After that I got a
[commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64),
and eventually an [Amiga 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500). I got my first PC at 1996, which is also the year I began studying
[Architecture in Istanbul Technical University](http://www.itu.edu.tr/en/academics/faculty/architecture). Unfortunately, after two years, I realised
it was not what I wanted to do. Between 1998 and 2000 I was busy with my band, and trying to
decide what I wanted to do with my life. My band was called [Pagan](https://myspace.com/pagantr) which I formed with
some high school friends. We were one of the first Black Metal bands to come from Turkey.
In the mean time I began working in an Internet Service Provider which were quite
new. Internet was getting popular in Turkey at that time, with people
using dial up services with 56k modems. I was interested in this new technology, mainly
because I had a 14k modem since 1996 and was using very first Internet services like ICQ,
e-mail, IRC for a while.

The first ISP I worked for was [SuperOnline](http://www.superonline.net/), one of the most important initial ISPs of
Turkey. Today they are still around, but not as big as they used to be. I started as
a technical support desk agent there, as I knew how to use the internet, and could help
people get connected. While I was working there, I was inspired by the IT industry
and decided to do my major in Computer Science. In year 2000 I began my studies in
[Istanbul Bilgi University](http://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/). Bilgi University is a private university, but I had
scholarship from Turkish government so I didn't have to pay tuitions. At the same time
I began working in another ISP called [NetOne](http://www.netone.com.tr/). NetOne was a smaller company than
SuperOnline, but they had a more high end clientele, they served mostly corporate
customers. They had their own satellite link through their partner company Satko,
which provided satellite communications. In this regard, NetOne was one of the few
ISPs in Turkey with their own dedicated satellite link.

In 2002, I quit my job at NetOne to focus on my studies. The Computer Science department
of Istanbul Bilgi University was run by English [Chris Stephenson](http://vimeo.com/chrisstephenson/videos). Unlike other Computer
Science/Engineering departments in Turkey, which followed MicroSoft industry standards
in their curriculum, Bilgi University teached in Java (which was new at the time),
thought Functional Programming (with [Scheme](http://racket-lang.org/)), and basic Computer Science subjects in
a free and [Open Source](http://www.ozguryazilimgunleri.org.tr/2011/about/index9ed2.html?lang=en) environment.
It was here when I first learned to use Linux, and get to meet one of my personal heroes,
[Richard Stallman](http://vimeo.com/3210935) in person and get initiated in the church of Emacs.

During my studies in Bilgi University, I got captivated by Japanese culture, and began
taking Japanese lessons. I spent the summer of 2003 in Japan in volunteer workcamps organised by [NICE](http://nice1.gr.jp/e/indexe.html).
After my graduation I moved to Japan by the end of 2004. In 2005 I started
taking Japanese lessons in [Takushoku University](http://www.takushoku-u.ac.jp/english/) and researched post graduate opportunities
in Japan. In 2006 I got accepted to [Keio University Computer Science](http://www.ics.keio.ac.jp/drupal/en) master's programme.
I studied in [Amano Laboratory](http://am.ics.keio.ac.jp/wp/) in Keio University, and my research topic was memory optimization
for embedded processors. I got my master's degree in 2008 from Keio University in Master of
Engineering in Science. From 2008 to 2011 I studied for my Ph D in Keio University
in the same laboratory and field. Unfortunately during this time, I realised I wanted
to work on a more software related field rather than hardware, so I quit my studies in 2011
and began working for my first company, Mobilous.
